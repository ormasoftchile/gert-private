## 2026-08-17 — Runtime Portability Negotiation Concluded

**Status:** Design agreed, gate closed, Phase 1 scope finalized.

**Negotiation:** Four-round multi-agent negotiation with SQL Live-Site Operations on runtime portability for Gert runbooks (rounds 2–4; round 1 committed as d355bf5).

**Key technical outcomes:**
- AllowedEnvironments/AllowedModes field separation (profile contexts vs RunMode)
- Approval gate coverage closure (direct-invocation path enforcement added to Phase 1)
- Grandfathering rule for interactive unspecified (legacy 
equires-approval: false acts as read-only override)
- Declared attendance orthogonal to context (fixes TTYOutput conflation, resolves CI blocking-on-stdin bug)
- Test-context binding restriction at plan time (native-only default, subprocess opt-in, mcp-http never)
- OQ2 closed as subprocess continuation with Phase 0 framing deliverables

**Agents involved:** Barbara (architect), Don (backend verification), David (round 1).

**Design principle:** Fail-closed by default; explicit migration paths for breaking changes; source-grounded verification.

**Impact:** Phase 1 addition ~4 days. All blocking conditions satisfied. Implementation starts this week.


## 2026-08-17 — Phase 1 Closure: Runtime Portability Complete

**Status:** COMPLETE — code exit 0, test exit 0, zero FAIL. 33 architectural rulings. All blocks satisfied.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Tri-state RequiresApproval (bool → *bool) + Classification field added
- ProfileApprovalGate + declared attendance implemented
- MCP HTTP transport (Don), auth provider (David), fixture migration (Tess), schema validation (Ken), profile spec (Edith)
- 31 conformance vectors: 31 PASS / 0 SKIP / 0 FAIL
- SQL Live-Site counterparty: 3 counter-positions accepted, refined

**Deferred:** AllowedModes field (RunMode separate from context), per-tool auth override (Phase 3), lifecycle sanity (Phase 3)

**Next phase:** OQ2 (library vs. subprocess) spike; resolver extends --package-map; Phase 2 host bridge with explicit framing protocol
